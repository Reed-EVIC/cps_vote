# cpsvote

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`cpsvote` is an R package to interface with data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) Voting and Registration Supplement, a biennial supplement to the CPS from the US Census Bureau.

## Sources

1994-2016 come from the [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://data.nber.org/cps/). 2018 comes from the [US Census Bureau](https://thedataweb.rm.census.gov/ftp/cps_ftp.html).

## Testing

1. `devtools::load_all()` will load the package
2. `cpsvote::download_data(path = "dir", years = seq(start,end,sequence))` will download data
3. `cpsvote::read_cps()` will read all data files (1994 - 2018)
4. `cpsvote::read_cps(path = "dir", years = seq(start,end,sequence)` will read data into memory

## Outputs

Still working on it, but this!
