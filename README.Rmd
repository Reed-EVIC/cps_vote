`cpsvote` provides an automated method for downloading, recoding, and merging selected years of the Current Population Survey's 
Voting and Registration Supplement, a biennial large-N survey about voter registration, voting, and non-voting in United States Federal Elections. The
package provides documentation for appropriate use of sample weights to generate statistical estimates. The package includes multiple vignettes
that illustrate different applications. 

## Sources

All years of data come from the [National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)](https://data.nber.org/cps/), and the CPS is administered by the [US Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html).

## Process

A few main functions of this package are to:

1. Download the CPS data (`cps_download_data`) and documentation (`cps_download_docs`) from NBER

2. Load the raw, numeric CPS data into R (`cps_read`)

3. Help you apply the correct factor labels to this numeric data (`cps_label`)

4. Access a "basic" version of the CPS that we have included with the package (`cps_load_basic`)

For help with these, see the documentation for these functions and the vignettes. Additional vignettes are provided with examples of some basic analyses that are possible with the CPS.

## Instructions for Alpha Testing

### Basic Use Information

1. *Install the Package*
   i) If you are a primary developer / contributor and are using a localized version control system, create your version control project
  using this URL: https://github.com/Reed-EVIC/cpsvote.git. 
      a) `devtools::load_all()` will load the package and all the associated functions.
   ii) If you are a tester, you may follow the procedure above, or else you can install the package using `remotes`:
      b) `remotes::install_github(https://github.com/Reed-EVIC/cpsvote)`
  
2. *Download the CPS Files*
    i) `cpsvote` will download the CPS files directly from two federal data repositories (data.nber.org/cps/cpsnov for 
  years 1994 - 2016; thedataweb.rm.census.gov/pub/cps/supps/ for 2018). By default `cpsvote` will create a new subdirectory
  in your working directory names "./cps_data" and store the compressed data files in that location.
    ii) If you choose to download data files and store them in a separate location, `cpsvote` can only process files that retain
  the original file name. See the "Data Description" vignette for a list of the expected file names.
    iii) `cpsvote::download_data(path = "dir", years = seq(start,end,sequence))` will download data
         a) Example: `cpsvote::download_data()` will download all data files  and place the files in the default download path ("./cps_data").
         b) Example: `cpsvote::download_data(path = "~/mydata/CPS", years = seq(2000, 2014, 4))` will download the 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012 CPS 
  and place them in the path "~/mydata/CPS".

3. *Import the Data Into R and Create a Dataframe*
   i) `cpsvote` performs a series of data transformations that produce a set of comparably coded variables across all of the survey years. These
  variables are listed in the "Data Description" vignette.
   ii) `cpsvote::read_cps(data_dir = "dir", years = seq(start,end,sequence))` will read CPS data files located in "data_dir" into memory.  A reminder
  that the file names need to  be unmodified from what is stored at data.nber.org and thedataweb.rm.census.gov
       a) Example: `cps_vote <- cpsvote::read_cps()` will read all data files (1994 - 2018) from the default directory ("./cps_data"), recode columns
  to a common coding scheme, and merge into a single data frame labeled
  "cps_vote". 
       b) Example: `cps_vote <- cpsvote::read_cps(data_dir = "~/mydata/CPS), years = seq(1994, 2000, 2))` will load CPS from 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000, 
  assuming  the data files are stored in "~/mydata/CPS", perform recodes, merge, and label "cps_vote".  
  
4. *Download documentation*
   i) `cpsvote::download_docs()` downloads all documentation files, and places them in "./cps_docs"
   ii) `cpsvote::download_docs(path = "dir", years = seq(start, end, seqquence)` allows you to control the target directory and 
   years for the documentation.
  
### Recommended First Steps

The steps shown below install the package locally, downlaod all CPS files from 1994 - 2018, load the files into memory, and results in a data frame
with CPS Voting and Registration Supplement data from 1994-2018. 

1. `remotes::install_github(https://github.com/Reed-EVIC/cpsvote)`
2. `library(cpsvote)`
3. `cpsvote::download_data()` (Only necessary if using the package for the first time; after that, the files will already be downloaded and you 
can skip this step)
4. `cps_vote <- cpsvote::read_cps()` Will read all available years into memory, places it in a data frame named `cps_vote`

## Advanced Use: Manually Adding Variables to the Output Dataset 

We do not recommend adding variables at this time. However, if you wish to modify `cpsvote` to add variables from individual years of the CPS, follow
these steps. To identify the names, column locations, and factor levels for new variables, please refer to the documentation for individual
years of the CPS. 

1. Open the Excel sheet `CPS_catalog.xlsx` (in "data-raw" subdirectory). The `master` tab contains the names and column locations for the variables to be read by `cpsvote`. The individual year tabs (e.g. `1994`, `1996`, ..., `2018`) contain the factor levels ("value labels").
2. On the `master` tab, you must enter at a minimum the `year` (column B), the `orig_col` (column C), the `start` col (column D), and the `end` col (column D). 
3. On the individual year tabs, enter factor levels as appropriate *if* you want these factor levels to be included in the output data. *Important note*, if factor levels change over the years, the levels are not recoded so as to be comparable for these new variables. New variables may be
added to `cpsvote` in the future, and we will assure that levels are comparable across years 

Once you have completed these steps, you *must source the `save_catalog.R` script, or else `fwf_key` will not be updated to include your new columns.
