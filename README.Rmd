`cpsvote` provides an automated method for downloading, recoding, and merging selected years of the Current Population Survey's 
Voting and Registration Supplement, a biennial large-$N$ survey about voter registration, voting, and non-voting in United States federal elections. The
package provides documentation for appropriate use of sample weights to generate statistical estimates. The package includes multiple vignettes
that illustrate different applications. 

## Sources

All years of data come from the [National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)](https://data.nber.org/cps/), and the CPS is administered by the [US Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html).

## Process

A few main purposess of this package are to:

1. Download the CPS data (`cps_download_data`) and documentation (`cps_download_docs`) from NBER

2. Load the raw, numeric CPS data into R (`cps_read`)

3. Help you apply the correct factor labels to this numeric data (`cps_label`)

4. Access a "basic" version of the CPS that we have included with the package (`cps_load_basic`)

For help with these, see the documentation for these functions and the vignettes. Additional vignettes are provided with examples of some basic analyses that are possible with the CPS.

## Instructions for Alpha Testing

### Basic Use Information

1. *Install the Package*
   i) If you are a tester, you can install the package using `remotes`:
      
    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    remotes::install_github("Reed-EVIC/cpsvote")
    library(cpsvote)
    ```
      
      
   ii) If you are a primary developer / contributor and are using a localized version control system, create your version control project
  using this URL: https://github.com/Reed-EVIC/cpsvote.git. 
      a) `devtools::load_all()` will load the package and all the associated functions.

2. *Quickly view some CPS data*
    i) There is far more data included in the full CPS than we could include here, but there are two options to view a  subset of the CPS data with ease.
        a) Running `data(cps_sample_10k, package = 'cpsvote')` will load a 10,000 row sample of selected CPS columns into your environment.
        b) Running `cpsvote::cps_load_basic()` will download the data, and provide you all rows and a selected set of CPS columns, and allow you to save a copy locally for speed in the future.
  
3. *Download the CPS Files*
    i) `cpsvote` will download the CPS files directly from a federal data repository (http://data.nber.org/data/current-population-survey-data.html for 
  years 1994 - 2018). By default `cpsvote` will create a new subdirectory
  in your working directory named "cps_data" and store the compressed data files in that location.
    ii) If you choose to download data files and store them in a separate location, `cpsvote` can only process files that retain
  the original file name. See the "Data Description" vignette for a list of the expected file names.
    iii) `cpsvote::cps_download_data(path = "dir", years = seq(start,end,sequence))` will download data
         a) Example: `cpsvote::cps_download_data()` will download all data files and place the files in the default download path ("./cps_data").
         b) Example: `cpsvote::cps_download_data(path = "~/mydata/CPS", years = seq(2000, 2014, 4))` will download the 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012 CPS 
  and place them in the path "~/mydata/CPS".
    iv) `cpsvote::cps_download_docs()` downloads all documentation files, and places them in "./cps_docs"
    v) `cpsvote::cps_download_docs(path = "dir", years = seq(start, end, seqquence)` allows you to control the target directory and 
   years for the documentation.

4. *Import the Data Into R and Create a Data Frame*
   i) `cpsvote` performs a series of data transformations that produce a set of comparably coded variables across all of the survey years. These
  variables are listed in the "Data Description" vignette.
   ii) `cpsvote::read_cps(dir = "dir", years = seq(start,end,sequence))` will read CPS data files located in "dir" into memory. A reminder
  that the file names must contain the 4-digit year associated with their data in order to be read easily.
       a) Example: `cps_vote <- cpsvote::cps_read()` will read all data files (1994 - 2018) from the default directory ("./cps_data"), and merge into a single data frame called
  "cps_vote". 
       b) Example: `cps_vote <- cpsvote::cps_read(data_dir = "~/mydata/CPS", years = seq(1994, 2000, 2))` will load CPS data from 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000, 
  assuming the data files are stored in "~/mydata/CPS", and merge into the object "cps_vote".

5. *Attach proper labels to the numeric data*
    i) By default, the CPS comes with numeric data values. These correspond to factor codes as detailed in the survey documentation. The `cps_label` function applies given factor codes to this numeric data in order to make it human-readable.

6. *Attach proper turnout modifiers*
    i) Certain steps have to be taken to properly reweight the CPS for voter turnout analyses. The functions `cps_recode_vote` and `cps_reweight_turnout` help to redo these codings to appropriately calculate voter turnout.
  
### Recommended First Steps

The steps shown below install the package locally, download all CPS files from 1994 - 2018, load the files into memory, and results in a data frame
with CPS Voting and Registration Supplement data from 1994-2018. 

1. `remotes::install_github("Reed-EVIC/cpsvote")`
2. `library(cpsvote)`
3. `cpsvote::cps_download_data()` (Only necessary if using the package for the first time; after that, the files will already be downloaded and you 
can skip this step)
4. `cps_vote <- cpsvote::cps_read()` Will read all available years into memory, merging them in a data frame named `cps_vote`

## Advanced Use: Manually Adding Variables to the Output Dataset 

Adding variables at this time is tricky, and we can't guarantee yet that it will work smoothly. However, if you wish to modify `cpsvote` to add variables from individual years of the CPS, you can make edited versions of the included objects `cps_cols` and `cps_factors`. To identify the names, column locations, and factor levels for new variables, please refer to the documentation for individual
years of the CPS (`cpsvote::cps_download_docs()`). 

For an example, let's say that I wanted to add annual family income in 2006 and 2008 to the default data. First, I would define the column positions and factor levels for income and add them to the default `cps_cols` and `cps_factors`.

```{r}
library(cpsvote)
library(dplyr)

income_cols <- data.frame(
  year = c(2006, 2008),
  cps_name = "HUFAMINC",
  new_name = "INCOME",
  start_pos = 39,
  end_pos = 40,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

income_factors <- data.frame(
  year = c(rep(2006, 16), rep(2008, 16)),
  cps_name = "HUFAMINC",
  new_name = "INCOME",
  code = c(1:16, 1:16),
  value = rep(c("LESS THAN $5,000",
                "5,000 TO 7,499",
                "7,500 TO 9,999",
                "10,000 TO 12,499",
                "12,500 TO 14,999",
                "15,000 TO 19,999",
                "20,000 TO 24,999",
                "25,000 TO 29,999",
                "30,000 TO 34,999",
                "35,000 TO 39,999",
                "40,000 TO 49,999",
                "50,000 TO 59,999",
                "60,000 TO 74,999",
                "75,000 TO 99,999",
                "100,000 TO 149,999",
                "150,000 OR MORE"), 2),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

my_cols <- bind_rows(cps_cols, income_cols)
my_factors <- bind_rows(cps_factors, income_factors)
```

Then, I read in the 2006 and 2008 CPS data using my new column data, and factor it with my new factor data.

```{r}
cps_income <- cps_read(years = c(2006, 2008),
                       cols = my_cols) %>%
  cps_label(factors = my_factors)
```

Now we can look at the unweighted breakdown of income by year.

```{r}
janitor::tabyl(cps_income, INCOME, YEAR)
```
