`cpsvote` is an R package to interface with data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) Voting and Registration Supplement, a biennial supplement to the monthly CPS.

## Sources

All years of data come from the [National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)](https://data.nber.org/cps/), and the CPS is administered by the [US Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html).

## Process

A few main functions of this package are to:

1. Download the CPS data (`cps_download_data`) and documentation (`cps_download_docs`) from NBER

2. Load the raw, numeric CPS data into R (`cps_read`)

3. Help you apply the correct factor labels to this numeric data (`cps_label`)

4. Access a "basic" version of the CPS that we have included with the package (`cps_load_basic`)

For help with these, see the documentation for these functions and the vignettes. Additional vignettes are provided with examples of some basic analyses that are possible with the CPS.

## Outputs

Still working on it, but this!
