`cpsvote` is an R package to interface with data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) Voting and Registration Supplement, a biennial supplement to the monthly CPS.

## Sources

All years of data come from the [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://data.nber.org/cps/), and the CPS is administered by the US Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

## Process

There are a few main things this package can do

1. Download the CPS data (`cps_download_data`, `cps_download_docs`)

2. Load the raw, numeric CPS data into R (`cps_read`)

3. Help you apply the correct factor labels to this numeric data (`cps_label`)

4. Access a "basic" version of the CPS that we have included with the package (`cps_load_basic`)

## Outputs

Still working on it, but this!
