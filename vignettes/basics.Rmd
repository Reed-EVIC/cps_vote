`cpsvote` helps you work with data from the Current Population Survey's (CPS) Voting and Registration Supplement (VRS), published by the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics. This high-quality survey has been conducted after every federal election (in November of even years) since the 1960s. The raw data, archived by the [National Bureau of Economic Research](http://data.nber.org/data/current-population-survey-data.html), is spread across several fixed-width files with different question locations and formats. This package consolidates common questions and provides the data in a structure that is much easier to work with and interpret, since some of the basic factor recoding has already been done.
